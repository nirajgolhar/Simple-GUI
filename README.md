# Simple-GUI
Swing is outdated, but a good way to start learning. Swing has code that lets us call methods with GUI objects to make our own GUI. 

I hope this helps you make your first java gui :)

FOR OPENING THIS PROJECT
Step 1: simply download/clone this project folder to your drive "Our First GUI"
Step 2: Run the java class from src folder and enjoy.
